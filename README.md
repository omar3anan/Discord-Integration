    <h1>Discord Integration and Message Search</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our Discord integration and message search application.</p>
    <h2>Step 1: Create a Discord App</h2>
    <p>To get started, you'll need to create a Discord application. You can do this by visiting the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications" target="_blank">Discord Developer Portal</a>.</p>
    <h2>Step 2: Get Authorization</h2>
    <p>After creating the app, you'll need to obtain authorization from users to access their Discord chats. This usually involves implementing OAuth2 for user authentication. Refer to the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2" target="_blank">Discord OAuth2 documentation</a> for details.</p>
    <h2>Step 3: Access Messages</h2>
    <p>Once authorized, you can use the Discord API to access messages from the chat. You'll need to use the <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#get-channel-messages" target="_blank">GET Channel Messages endpoint</a> to retrieve messages.</p>
    <h2>Step 4: Search Messages</h2>
    <p>To search for specific keywords or questions within the messages, you'll need to iterate through the retrieved messages and apply your search logic. JavaScript is commonly used for this purpose.</p>
    <h2>Step 5: Filter Technical Keywords</h2>
    <p>To filter messages for technical keywords, you can use regular expressions or simple string matching algorithms to identify relevant content in the messages.</p>
    <h2>Step 6: Store and Display Results</h2>
    <p>Store the relevant messages or data in a format suitable for your needs (e.g., in a database or a JSON file) and display the results to the user, such as in a web interface or a GitHub README file.</p>
    <h2>Additional Resources</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro" target="_blank">Discord Developer Documentation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript Documentation</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember that this is a simplified overview, and you'll need to develop the actual application logic and server-side components to make this work. For more specific guidance and code examples, refer to the documentation provided by Discord and other relevant sources.</p>
